Project Title: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing

Objective::

Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing patterns to define distinct groups.
Develop targeted marketing strategies based on insights derived from identified customer segments.



Prerequisites ::

Python 3.x
Python libraries:
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SciPy (for statistical tests)
Understanding of basic machine learning concepts, particularly clustering.
Basic understanding and experience with Git and GitHub.

Data Exploration and Cleaning::
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Analyze missing values, data types, and potential outliers.
Handle incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent data.

Feature Engineering::
Derive meaningful features from the existing data, such as:
Total customer spending
Average transaction value
Purchase frequency

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)::
Use visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the customer data.
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for relevant features across the dataset.

Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning::
Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm (or experiment with other clustering techniques) to segment customers.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.

Statistical Analysis::
Conduct statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-square) to confirm significant differences between the customer segments.
