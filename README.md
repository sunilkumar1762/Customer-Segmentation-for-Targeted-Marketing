Project 1: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing

Objective:
To perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior and demographics to identify
distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

Overview:
This project will utilize a dataset containing customer transaction data and demographic
information. You will apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to segment
customers into meaningful groups, enabling personalized marketing efforts.

CONCLUSION:::
The customer segmentation model using K-Means clustering has successfully identified three distinct customer segments based on their characteristics such as Age, Annual Income, Purchase History, Total Spend, Avg Transaction Value, and Purchase Frequency.

Segment 1 (High Spenders): This segment comprises customers with high annual incomes, high purchase history, and high total spend. They have a high average transaction value and purchase frequency, indicating a strong purchasing power.

Segment 2 (Medium Spenders): Customers in this segment have moderate annual incomes, moderate purchase history, and total spend. Their average transaction value and purchase frequency are also moderate, suggesting a balanced spending behavior.

Segment 3 (Low Spenders): This segment includes customers with lower annual incomes, lower purchase history, and total spend. They exhibit lower average transaction values and purchase frequency, indicating a more conservative spending pattern.

The statistical validation using ANOVA and Chi-Square tests has confirmed significant differences between these customer segments, validating the effectiveness of the segmentation model.

Actionable Insights and Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing Strategies: Tailor marketing campaigns and promotions based on the spending behavior of each segment. For example, offer exclusive deals to High Spenders, loyalty programs for Medium Spenders, and budget-friendly options for Low Spenders.
Product Recommendations: Recommend products or services that align with the preferences and purchasing power of each segment to enhance customer engagement.
